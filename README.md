# vk_bot_detection
  In my project I have analyzed 37 features about VKontakte users and built 4 machine learning models that predict if a user is a bot or not. I have found out that using information about the friend network of a user can compement the existing methods of detecting social bots, improving the accuracy of the predictions of machine learning models. More information can be found in the docx file here: https://github.com/filipp134/vk_bot_detection/blob/main/Paper_on_social_bots.pdf
  
  Moreover, I have developed a Telegram bot that can make a prediction if a user is a bot or not based on the prediction given by the model built
  according to Random Forest approach. You can use this bot by going through this link: https://t.me/VK_detection_bot
  
  Due to a large file size, I couldn't publish the dataset ,which contains anonymized graph data with friend connections of 189505 VKontakte users I collected while conducting my project, on Github, so I published it on Zenodo, and it can be accessed here: https://zenodo.org/record/6035966#.YgoKcu5ByZw
  
  With this project I have advanced to the final stage of the 'Scientists of the Future' science fair, a national stage of ISEF. The finalist certificate can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PnEmz7lqOi5LPcs-qbjdp0_OaD3RfiJa/view.
