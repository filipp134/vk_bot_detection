# vk_bot_detection
  In my project I have analyzed 37 features about VKontakte users and built 3 machine learning models that predict if a user is a bot or not. I have found out that using information about the friend network of a user can compement the existing methods of detecting social bots, improving the accuracy of the predictions of machine learning models. More information can be found in the docx file here: https://github.com/filipp134/vk_bot_detection/blob/main/Detection%20of%20social%20bots%20on%20VKontakte%20social%20network.pdf
  
  Moreover, I have developed a Telegram bot that can make a prediction if a user is a bot or not based on the prediction given by the model built
  according to Random Forest approach. You can use this bot by going through this link: https://t.me/VK_detection_bot
